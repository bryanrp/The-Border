# The-Border

## 👋 Hello! 👋

This is the Unity files for my game 🕹️[The Border](https://brico.itch.io/the-border)🕹️. I made this game alone, without anybody to accompany me 😢. So the main purpose of this repo is for backup and version control. Once I know I can revert any changes easily, I'll be able to start taking action instead of planning meticulously for hours 🕒.

Most of the game files that I made (and from third parties) are in the 📁[Assets](https://github.com/bryanrp/The-Border/tree/main/Assets)📁 folder. This includes:
- 💻 C# scripts 💻 I made all the scripts, with minimal amount of copy and paste (I swear I'm honest 👀).
- 🖼️ Textures 🖼️ Most pixel arts are from [Zrghr](https://zrghr.itch.io/pixel), accompanied by some of my *✨ masterpiece ✨*.
- 🎶 Music and SFX 🎶 With my deep understanding of music theory, I chose [JimHall's](https://freemusicarchive.org/music/jim-hall) and [Dustyroom's](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/free-casual-game-sfx-pack-54116) score.
- 🧰 Premade Objects 🧰 
- 💼 and other files 💼 with some old files that I don't want to destroy 😅.

For now, I don't have any plan to continue making games, unless somebody wants to collaborate with me. Or even better, maybe you have a project and you need somebody to help or just to accompany your journey. Feel free to reach me and maybe you finally find your missing piece 😉.
